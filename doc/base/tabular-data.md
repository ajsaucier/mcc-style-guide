Tables are only to be used for data, not layout. Adding the class "table-responsive" directly to the table allows for horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.
### Accessibility Concerns
Tables must have heading cells to describe the data being represented. Table headers can have headings only for columns, rows, or both. See markup below for examples.

Tables should also have caption elements that briefly describe what the table contains. This should be placed directly after the opening table tag.
